How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It pointed to the line where the diffrence was occuring, which was much faster then manually doing it.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

   It helps to keep track of changes. I can retrore if 
I find the previous version better. I can always identify what changes were made and why.
